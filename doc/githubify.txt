GITHUBIFY
=================================================================================

The purpose of this plugin is to make it easy to create Github permalinks from
within vim, while browsing files. It defines a vim function |Githubify| (and
associated command !Githubify), which accepts the following arguments (all
optional).

    - lineno (integer): Nonzero will include the current line number in the
      permalink, zero will exclude the line number. By default, line number is
      included.

    - commit (string): The commit hash (or branch identifier) to link to. By
      default, uses HEAD (the current branch).

    - base_url (string): The base URL of the Github repository. By default,
      uses the value of the environment variable $GITHUBIFY_BASE_URL. Note: if
      neither this argument nor the enivronment variable are specified, the
      function will fail.

    - base_dir (string): The base directory of the repository on the local
      filesystem. By default, will use the current working directory of the vim
      session.

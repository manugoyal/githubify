# Githubify

This is a simple plugin to generate permalinks to Github for the current buffer
location in vim.

## Requirements

If running in neovim, you must set up python integration (see |:help
provider-python|).

To utilize the copy-to-clipboard functionality, you must install the `pyperclip`
module:

```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pyperclip
```
